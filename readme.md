# My Portfolio Website

This is the website that I plan on putting on my resume and how to showoff my projects. I might change the design a little but that is the generic shape that I plan on using.

# Portfolio Website

### How this came to be

While this is essentially my portfolio, I also hope to use this as way to keep my self honest and keep studying as much as I can. I learned HTML and CSS for this and plan to continue learning Javascript to add some more neat features to the website. One feature that I want to implement is having a little Wynaut follow the cursor, [similar to Neko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software)).
