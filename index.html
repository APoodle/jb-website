        <span style='font-size:48px; font-weight:bold;'>Hey ðŸ‘‹,</span> my name is Josue Bautista and I am currently learning everything and anything about software.
        I started a couple years ago with a main focus on Data Science, so I only used Python. I am currently going
        for a more generalist approach and just trying to learn as much as I can. While it is currently very barren here,
        I hope I can use this as a way to track my progress and motivate me to keep going.
        <br><br>
        P.S. I have a huge interest in learning real-life languages as well, I have started my journey with learning
        Korean (sadly my skills have completely atrophied), then I went to learn some Japanese (currently studying somewhat),
        while currently I have devoted the most effort and devotion to learning French (I hope to one day be able
        live in Paris!). I hopefully plan to dabble into Brazilian Portuguese and Catalan in the future!</p>

            I decided to participate this year in the kaggle competition, I am currently still working on it,
            but I plan on finishing it by the deadline in January.
